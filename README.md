# DnDSessionTracker
A python script that allows the DM to keep track of mobs, players, and items in the session

The DM will run the Driver.py file which will start the session. Before the session, all the items and mobs that a player could encounter is added. As the players pick up items, take damage, and consume items/resouces can be recorded from this script.
Once the session is done, the DM can simply save the file session (as a .pkl file) and resume the session at a later date.

-To be added:

- An actual UI that is not a console UI so it is a bit easier to naviagte
- Fix the OOP violations (don't affect functionality)
- THIS IS A HOMEBEW VERSION FOR A DARK SOULS III CAMPAIGN. I will be creating a vanilla version at some point for general use
